FL_INSURANCE_SAMPLE
The following data is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/sanjay0/fl-insurance-samplecsv which is taken from the kaggle source
* The sample insurance file contains 36,634 records in Florida for 2012 from a sample company that implemented an agressive growth plan in 2012.
* There are total insured value (TIV) columns containing TIV from 2011 and 2012, so this dataset is great for testing out the comparison feature.
*This file has address information that you can choose to geocode, or you can use the existing latitude/longitude in the file.
